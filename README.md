I've been using this to learn and get familiar with Godot.
So far I've learned/made:
- Movable character
-Variable jump height up until peak of jump
- Smooth camera
- Directional camera bias/look ahead
- Death when falling into killzone + disabled character movement when in killzone
- Eggs that can be picked up
- Moving platforms
- Learned how to use tilesets and character animations
- Learned how collision layers and masks work
- Learned how Z index works
